1. **Component Composition** - All patterns are built from existing components
2. **Mobile-First** - Optimized for 390px mobile viewport
3. **Consistent Navigation** - NavigationBar present on all screens
4. **Interactive** - Tap, swipe, and keyboard gestures throughout
5. **Exact Figma Implementation** - Matches design library precisely

## Usage in Your App

These patterns serve as templates for your meal planning app screens. Each pattern is a complete mobile screen layout showing how components work together.

```jsx
// Example: Using patterns in a React app with routing
import { 
  MealPlanningView,
  RecipesView, 
  RecipeDetailView, 
  ShoppingListView 
} from './patterns';

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/planning" element={<MealPlanningView />} />
      <Route path="/recipes" element={<RecipesView />} />
      <Route path="/recipe/:id" element={<RecipeDetailView />} />
      <Route path="/shopping-list" element={<ShoppingListView />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```

## Component Reusability

Every pattern uses the same core components:
- Consistent styling via design tokens
- Same interactions across screens
- Accessible keyboard navigation
- Base UI foundation for reliability
