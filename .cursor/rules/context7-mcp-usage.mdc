# Context7 MCP Usage

When working with libraries, frameworks, or APIs, ALWAYS use Context7 MCP to get accurate, up-to-date documentation and code examples.

## When to Use Context7

Use Context7 MCP automatically (without being asked) for:

1. **Library/API Documentation**
   - "How do I use React Router?"
   - "What's the Base UI Button API?"
   - Need to understand a library's features

2. **Code Generation**
   - Setting up authentication
   - Implementing API integrations
   - Using library-specific patterns

3. **Setup & Configuration**
   - Installing and configuring libraries
   - Setting up build tools
   - Deployment configurations

4. **Troubleshooting**
   - Library-specific errors
   - API usage issues
   - Best practices for specific libraries

## Usage Pattern

```
1. Call resolve-library-id first to get the library ID
2. Call query-docs with specific questions
3. Apply the documented approach
```

## Example

```markdown
User: "How do I use React Router for navigation?"

Assistant Actions:
1. Call resolve-library-id with "react-router"
2. Call query-docs with "How to set up navigation with Routes and Route components"
3. Implement based on documentation
```

## Key Principle

**Proactively** use Context7 when library knowledge is needed. Don't wait for the user to explicitly ask for documentation.
