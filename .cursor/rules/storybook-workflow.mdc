# Storybook Development Workflow

## MCP Server Integration

Before doing any UI, frontend or React development, **ALWAYS call the storybook MCP server** to get further instructions.

The Storybook MCP server provides:

1. **UI Building Instructions** - Standardized guidelines for component development
2. **Story URL Retrieval** - Direct links to view component stories
3. **Component Documentation** - Detailed documentation for all components
4. **Component Discovery** - List of available UI components

## When to Use Storybook MCP

Call the Storybook MCP server when:

- Creating new UI components
- Modifying existing components
- Writing component stories
- Needing to verify component appearance
- Looking for existing components to reuse
- Understanding component APIs and props

## Required: Storybook Must Be Running

The MCP server is only available when Storybook is running:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

The server runs at: `http://localhost:6006/mcp`

## Story Development Standards

When creating or modifying components:

1. Use CSF3 (Component Story Format 3) for stories
2. Create stories that demonstrate key component states
3. Link stories in component documentation
4. Ensure stories are accessible and well-documented
5. Use the MCP server to get story URLs for verification
