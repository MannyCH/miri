# Conventional Commit Messages

Use the Conventional Commit Messages specification for all commit messages.

## Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Types

- **fix**: Patches a bug (correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning)
- **feat**: Introduces a new feature (correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning)
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Breaking API change (correlates with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning)
- **Other types**: build, chore, ci, docs, style, refactor, perf, test

## Rules

1. Commits MUST be prefixed with a type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`)
2. A scope MAY be provided after a type (e.g., `fix(parser):`)
3. A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space
4. A longer body MAY be provided after the description (one blank line after)
5. Footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body
6. Breaking changes MUST be indicated either:
   - With `!` before the `:` (e.g., `feat!:`)
   - As a footer `BREAKING CHANGE: description`

## Examples

```
feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays

fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string

docs: update ref docs

feat!: send email on user creation

BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files
```
