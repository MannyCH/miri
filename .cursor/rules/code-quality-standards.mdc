# Code Quality Standards

## Information Accuracy

- Always verify information before presenting it
- Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence
- Check provided context files for current implementations

## Code Changes

- Make changes file by file to allow for review
- Provide all edits in a single chunk per file (not multi-step instructions)
- Preserve existing code and functionalities unless explicitly requested to change
- Don't remove unrelated code or features

## Communication Style

- Never apologize or use phrases like "sorry"
- Avoid unnecessary feedback about understanding ("I understand", "got it")
- Don't summarize changes made unless explicitly requested
- Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in context
- Avoid phrases like "make sure", "verify", "check" when the answer is visible

## Code Suggestions

- Don't suggest whitespace or indentation changes unless requested
- Don't invent changes beyond what's explicitly requested
- Don't suggest updates when no actual modifications are needed
- Don't show or discuss current implementation unless specifically requested

## File References

- Always provide links to real files, not placeholder names
- Do not reference or consider placeholder files from previous runs
- Complain if contents are the same as previous runs

## Implementation

- Don't ask users to verify implementations visible in the context
- Focus on requested changes only
- Keep changes minimal and targeted
