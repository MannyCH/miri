# Design Systems Checklist

Source: https://tylercoderre.com/projects/design-systems-checklist.html by Tyler Coderre

## Design Language

This is how your product "talks" to people. It's the look, feel, and flow that makes everything feel connected. When it all works together, users don't have to think too hard.

### Brand

Your brand is more than a logo or a cool name. It's what you stand for and how people remember you. It should guide every decision you make.

- [ ] **Vision** - Why you exist, what you believe in, and what direction you're going.
- [ ] **Design Principles** - Your go-to rules for making design choices. They help keep your work focused and clear.
- [ ] **Tone of Voice** - How you sound when you talk to users. This helps make sure people always know it's you speaking, no matter where they are. (WCAG: 3.1, 3.1.1–3.1.6)
- [ ] **Terminology** - Pick the right words and use them the same way across your product. This keeps things simple and clear. (WCAG: 3.1.3–3.1.6)
- [ ] **Brand Assets** - Things like your logo, fonts, colors, and icons. Using them the same way everywhere helps your product look and feel like one solid thing.

### Guidelines

You lose if your product feels different every time someone uses it. Clear guidelines help your team stay on the same page and create a consistent experience.

- [ ] **Accessibility** - Make sure everyone can use your product. Use clear color contrast, logical layout, and support for screen readers and other tools. (WCAG: All Criteria)
- [ ] **Writing Guidelines** - Set the rules for how you write. Things like grammar, tone, and word choice should all match. (WCAG: 3.1, 3.1.1–3.1.6)
- [ ] **Microcopy Guidelines** - Short UI text like button labels, error messages, and tooltips should follow consistent rules. (WCAG: 3.1.2–3.1.4)
- [ ] **Terminology** - Pick the right words once, and use them everywhere. This avoids confusion and keeps things running smoothly. (WCAG: 3.1.3, 3.1.4, 3.1.6)
- [ ] **Internationalization** - Plan for translation. Set up rules for handling different languages, longer words, and right-to-left text when needed. (WCAG: 3.1, 3.1.1–3.1.6)

## Foundations

This is the base layer of your design system. Stuff like colors, fonts, and tokens live here. When you change something here, it ripples out through everything else... so it's important to get it right.

### Color

Color isn't just for looks. It helps people understand what to do, what matters, and what to pay attention to.

- [ ] **Accessibility** - Make sure your color choices have enough contrast so text is easy to read. Always check your background and text pairings meet at least AA standards. (WCAG: 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.6)
- [ ] **Semantic Colors** - Besides your main brand colors, set up specific colors for things like disabled buttons, background areas, links, and alerts. These should all have a clear role. (WCAG: 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.6)
- [ ] **Dark Mode** - Make a version of your color palette that works in dark mode so your product can match the user's system settings without breaking. (WCAG: 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.6)
- [ ] **Guidelines** - Write down how to use your colors, when to use them, and what to avoid. (WCAG: 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.6)

### Layout

A good layout helps people make sense of what they're looking at. Using a consistent grid and spacing makes things easier to scan and more comfortable to use.

- [ ] **Order & Sequence** - Content should be laid out in such a way that it will make logical sense to read as well as be read to in order by assistive technologies. (WCAG: 1.3.1, 1.3.2)
- [ ] **Units** - Start small. Use a clear set of spacing values like 4, 8, 12, and 16. These give you a solid base to build your grid and layout.
- [ ] **Grid** - Use a grid to keep things aligned and balanced. Set up versions for mobile, tablet, and desktop with clear rules for columns, gutters, and margins.
- [ ] **Breakpoints** - Decide ahead of time which screen sizes your design should respond to. (WCAG: 1.3.4)
- [ ] **Spacing** - Keep spacing between elements consistent, both up-and-down and side-to-side. Use simple spacing rules that aren't tied to the grid so you have flexibility.

### Typography

Text is how most people get info from your product. A clear type scale with good structure helps users read faster and understand what matters.

- [ ] **Responsiveness** - Font sizes should adjust to the screen size. Bigger text works on desktop, but on smaller screens, scale it down so everything still feels balanced. (WCAG: 1.4.4, 1.4.5, 1.4.8, 1.4.9, 1.4.10, 1.4.12)
- [ ] **Grid Relation** - Line height and font size should work with your layout grid. This helps text line up nicely with icons, buttons, and other UI pieces. (WCAG: 1.4.4, 1.4.10, 1.4.12)
- [ ] **Readability** - Make sure your text isn't too tight or too loose. Watch the spacing between letters, the height between lines, and the length of each line. (WCAG: 1.4.8, 1.4.12)
- [ ] **Performance** - Custom fonts can slow things down, especially on the web. Use fast-loading fonts and have backups ready. System fonts are a solid choice if speed is a top priority.
- [ ] **Guidelines** - Document how to use typography, which styles to use where, and what to avoid.

### Iconography

Icons are quick visual cues that help people understand actions or content fast. When used right, they make the interface easier to use. When used randomly, they just create noise.

- [ ] **Accessibility** - If an icon does something or means something, give it an accessible name so screen readers can describe it. If it's just for decoration, no name needed. (WCAG: 1.1.1, 1.3.1, 1.3.6)
- [ ] **Style** - Pick a style—like outline or filled—and stick with it. (WCAG: 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.6)
- [ ] **Naming** - Name your icons based on what they do, not what they look like. For example, call it "play" instead of "triangle." (WCAG: 3.1.2–3.1.5)
- [ ] **Grid Alignment** - Design icons in a size and shape that fits your layout grid. (WCAG: 1.3.1, 1.3.2)
- [ ] **Keywords** - Add extra keywords to your icon library to make finding the right one faster and easier. (WCAG: 3.1.2–3.1.5)
- [ ] **Reserved Icons** - Keep some icons locked in for specific uses, like navigation or delete. Don't let them get reused for random stuff.
- [ ] **Guidelines** - Set rules for how and when to use icons, and what to avoid. Consistency goes a long way.

### Elevation

Elevation is how you show that one thing sits above another in your interface. In light mode, that usually means shadows. In dark mode, it's done with different background colors.

- [ ] **Shadow** - Set up a few shadow styles that match your elevation levels. Most products only need about 3 or 4. (WCAG: 1.3.1, 1.3.3)
- [ ] **Background Color** - In dark mode, shadows don't always work well. Use slightly different background colors to show depth instead. (WCAG: 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.6, 1.4.11)
- [ ] **Z-Index** - Create a clear system for z-index values so you know what should sit on top of what.

### Motion

Motion helps guide people through your product. It can show what's changing, what just happened, or what to focus on. Used right, it feels smooth and helpful. Used wrong, it just gets in the way.

- [ ] **Accessibility** - Always check for reduced motion settings. If someone prefers less motion, make sure your animations either tone it down or turn off. (WCAG: 2.2.1, 2.2.3, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3)
- [ ] **Easing** - Set a few standard easing types like standard, fast-in, and slow-out. These help your animations feel natural and consistent. (WCAG: 2.2.1, 2.2.3, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3)
- [ ] **Duration** - Pick a few go-to timing values for how long animations should run. This keeps things feeling smooth and avoids weird jumps or delays. (WCAG: 2.2.1, 2.2.3, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3)

---

## Core Components

Core components are the basic building blocks of your interface. They show up everywhere in your product, like buttons, inputs, and toggles. Reusing them helps reduce design and tech debt, keeps things consistent, and speeds up development.

### Accordion (Collapse)

- [ ] **Open vs Closed** - Two main states. If there's an icon (like an arrow), it should clearly show which state it's in. (WCAG: 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.4.13)

### Badge (Chip & Tag)

- [ ] **Color** - Use different colors to show different meanings. Make sure text or icon on top has enough contrast. Not the sole meaning of status for colorblind users. (WCAG: 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.6, 1.4.11)
- [ ] **Variants** - Some can be bold and bright, others more subtle with soft backgrounds. (WCAG: 1.4.1)
